# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. 
# The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. 
# Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
# Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
# Output: [7,0,8]
# Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
# 0 <= Node.val <= 9
# It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
# time complexity: O(max(n, m)) where n and m are lengths of l1 and l2
# space complexity: O(max(n, m)) for the result list
